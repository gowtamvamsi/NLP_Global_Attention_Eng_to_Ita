# NLP_Global_Attention_Eng_to_Ita
In this project I implement Neural Machine Translation using Attention mechanism. The code is written using the TensorFlow library in Python. I have used TensorFlow functionalities like tf.data.Dataset to manage the input pipeline, Eager Execution and Model sub classing to create the model architecture.
